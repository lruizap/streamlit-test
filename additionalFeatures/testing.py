"""
Good development hygiene includes testing your code. 

Automated testing allows you to write higher quality code, faster! Streamlit has a built-in testing framework that let's you build tests easily. 

Use your favorite testing framework to run your tests. We like `pytest`. 

When you test a Streamlit app, you simulate running the app, declare user input, and inspect the results. 

You can use GitHub workflows to automate your tests and get instant alerts about breaking changes. 

Learn more in our guide to App testing.
