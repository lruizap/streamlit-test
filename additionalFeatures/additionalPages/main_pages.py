"""
As apps grow large, it becomes useful to organize them into multiple pages. This makes the app easier to manage as a developer and easier to navigate as a user. Streamlit provides a frictionless way to create multipage apps.

We designed this feature so that building a multipage app is as easy as building a single-page app! Just add more pages to an existing app as follows:

In the folder containing your main script, create a new pages folder. Letâ€™s say your main script is named main_page.py.

Add new .py files in the pages folder to add more pages to your app.

Run streamlit run main_page.py as usual.

Thatâ€™s it! The main_page.py script will now correspond to the main page of your app. And youâ€™ll see the other scripts from the pages folder in the sidebar page selector. The pages are listed according to filename (without file extensions and disregarding underscores)
